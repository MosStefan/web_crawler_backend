## Implementation
**Web crawler** uses Depth-First-Search (**DFS**) for search data. The search starts from the **seed URL** and continue the hyperlinks until the pre-defined depth limit is reached, or there are no more hyperlinks.

* Using client with non-blocking calls and multiple threads.

* Generate random user-agent for each new request

* Crawling depth must be defined

 Web crawler built with Spring WebFlux, Reactive API, Reactive MongoDB and JSoup library
